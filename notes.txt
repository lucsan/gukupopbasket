You should:
Implement the cart logic, load products and add / remove  buttons (left side)
Add the presentation logic to update "Order summary" subsection whenever a product is added or removed (right site).

Take into account the following aspects:
Only Vanilla JS (ES5 & ES6) and JQuery is allowed is this exercise from JS perspective.
Feel free to use tooling (Task runners, unit test, linters or css pre-processors).
Follow the design as much as you can. Feel free to download the images that you consider.

Implement these products discounts that will be applied automatically under some conditions:
2-for-1 promotions: buy two of the same product, get one free, applied to GOKU items.
bulk discounts: buying x or more of a product, the price of that product is reduced, 
applied to NARU item. P.e. if you buy 3 or more NARU items, the price per unit should be 19.00€.
